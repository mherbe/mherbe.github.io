In this [project](/files/Project1.pdf)we gathered data about a local church. They wanted a new system built around there marriage preparation process. With the use of Google sheets and the use of Google's App Script feature which allowed us to write a script in a Javascript based language, we were able to create a new system that sent reminder emails, create folders for couples, and autogenerate checkboxes for the 11 files needed for the marriage process.
