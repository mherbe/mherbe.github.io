Utilizing Tableau and python we were able to understand and visualize our business. We analyzed over 13,000 meals and ran analysis on the local and global market. Our group was able to make data driven decisions by utilizing our data science skills. Our [write up](/files/seedbusiness.pdf) consisted of 30 pages and detailed our path of making our business come to life.

For one of the sections of our project we needed to individually select certain seeds from a dataset. We utilized jupyter notebooks to accomplish our intended purpose. The notebook and the documentation can be found [here](/files/FoodChange.ipynb) and the [csv](/files/meal.cvs) needed for the analysis.
