I am a May 2024 Graduate of Louisiana State University with a degree in B.S. Information Systems & Decision Sciences, and a Minor in Analytics. I have a very strong interest in coding, machine learning, general tech, cloud, and much more!


Data Driven Decision Making
======
Data-driven decision making is very important to me as it forms the bedrock of my approach to success. Understanding the nuances of user behavior, preferences, and trends empowers me to navigate the digital landscape effectively. By meticulously analyzing data from various sources, including website analytics, user feedback, and market research, I gain invaluable insights that inform every aspect of my strategy. From crafting compelling content to optimizing user experience and driving conversions, data guides my decisions, ensuring they are not just intuitive but grounded in evidence. Embracing a data-driven mindset allows me to continuously iterate, experiment, and refine, staying agile in a rapidly evolving digital world. Ultimately, it's not just about numbers; it's about leveraging data to create meaningful connections, drive results, and achieve success.

Data Science
======
Over the years, I have learned a great deal about Python and its methodologies, continually expanding my knowledge and expertise in this versatile programming language. From mastering its syntax to delving into advanced concepts like object-oriented programming, data manipulation, and algorithmic problem-solving, my journey with Python has been both rewarding and enlightening. I've honed my skills through practical application, tackling real-world challenges and embracing the ever-evolving landscape of Python libraries and frameworks. As I continue to explore its capabilities, I remain committed to staying abreast of emerging trends and best practices, ensuring that my Python proficiency remains sharp and adaptable.

Cloud Technology
------
With a class in AWS and Google cloud, I feel like I've equipped myself with the foundational knowledge and practical skills needed to navigate the vast and dynamic world of cloud computing. With a solid understanding of AWS and Google Cloud services, I'm prepared to harness the power of these platforms to build scalable, reliable, and efficient solutions for a wide range of applications. Whether it's deploying web applications, managing databases, implementing machine learning models, or optimizing infrastructure, I'm confident in my ability to leverage cloud technologies to drive innovation and deliver value to businesses and users alike.
